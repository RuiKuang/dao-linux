### DAO (Dynamic Analysis Omnibus) is a collection of debuggers and other related tools for Linux systems. ###

The first component of DAO is linja, a stealthy Linux debugger.  Written from the ground up to remain invisible to its targets, linja provides the same insight, control, and extensibility expected of a good debugger.

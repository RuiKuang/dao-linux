Brief Description
linja is a stealthy user-mode debugger for Linux systems.  Written from the
ground up to remain invisible to its targets, linja provides the same insight,
control, and extensibility expected of a good debugger.


Important
Currently, linja only supports 32-bit x86 systems running Linux.  Support
for other architectures and platforms will be made available in future
versions.


Requirements
linja requires the following additional software components:

c-inside 1.3
    - included in c-inside-1.3/ subdirectory
    - also available from http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/c-inside/
    - configure and build, but DO NOT INSTALL

Udis86 1.7
    - not included
    - available from http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/udis86/
    - extract into udis86-1.7/ subdirectory
    - configure and build, but DO NOT INSTALL
    - versions newer than 1.7 (such as 1.7.1, etc.) have not been tested


Installation
First, as mentioned above, extract Udis86 1.7 into the udis86-1.7/
subdirectory.  From within the c-inside-1.3/ and udis86-1.7/ directories, run
"./configure" and "make".  Do not, however, install these components.  They are
referenced in-place by the linja Makefile.

After the prerequisite libraries have been built, simply run "make" from within
the linja/ subdirectory.  This will build the linja executable in that
directory, and the example test programs in the examples/ directory.

Run linja by specifying a program as its only command line argument.
Example: "linja/linja examples/ptrace"

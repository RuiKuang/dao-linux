This file documents the examples provided with C-Inside, in the examples/
subdirectory.  These are just a few of the very simple, but interesting things
that can be done with C-Inside.  Additional examples will be provided in later
versions, and suggestions are always welcome.

Files with ".sh" extension are meant to be executables, interpreted by Bash.
You can simply run them, as in "./result.sh".

Files with ".ci" extension are meant to be interpreted by an installed copy of
c-inside.  If the c-inside binary is installed in /usr/local/bin/, then you can
simply run these files as well, as in "./errno.ci" or "./ls.ci *.sh".
Otherwise, you can run c-inside and supply the file name as the first argument,
for example: "c-inside errno.ci" or "c-inside ls.ci *.sh".


date.ci         display the current time and date

errno.ci        demonstrate the $errno built-in command

ls.ci           simple version of the "ls" command

mksock.ci       create a Unix socket file (similar to the "mksock" utility)

pwd.ci          emulate the "pwd" command, as a "one-liner"

result.sh       demonstrate various ways of obtaining the result of C-Inside
                command evaluation from within a shell script - examine the
                code in this script, it won't look too useful if you simply run
                it

timing.ci       demonstrate timing of functions
